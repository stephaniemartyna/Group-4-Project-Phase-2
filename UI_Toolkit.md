**Decision Title:** UI toolkit Selection

**Date:** Oct 17, 2023

**Team members:** Matthew Yackel, Sergei Mochalov, Steph Martyna, Martin Contreras

## Background
We will be developing a Study Planner mobile application, and one of the critical decisions we need to make is choosing a UI toolkit. The UI toolkit will impact the user interface and user experience of the application, as well as the efficiency and ease of development. We will be considering several options for this purpose, including React Native Elements, Native Base, Shoutem UI, Ant Design Mobile, and UI Kitten.

## Decision
After careful consideration, we have decided to use React Native Elements as the UI toolkit for our Study Planner App development.

## Reasoning 
The decision to choose React Native Elements is based on the following factors:
1. **Community Support and Popularity**: React Native Elements is a widely adopted and popular UI toolkit for React Native. It has a strong and active community, which means a wealth of resources, libraries, and support are available. This will facilitate troubleshooting and development.
2. **Customizability**: React Native Elements provides a high level of customizability, allowing us to tailor the UI components to our specific design requirements. This flexibility is essential in ensuring the app's aesthetics match our vision for a study planner.
3. **Component Library**: It offers a comprehensive library of pre-designed, consistent UI components, such as calendars, progress trackers, and notifications. This will significantly reduce development time and effort, helping us build the app faster.
4. **Performance**: React Native Elements is optimized for performance, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. This is crucial for a study planner app to provide a seamless experience to users.
7. **Ease of Integration**: It can be easily integrated with other popular libraries and tools commonly used in React Native development, simplifying the development process and enhancing the app's functionality.

## Consequences
By choosing React Native Elements as our UI toolkit for the Study Planner App, we expect the following consequences:
1. **Faster Development**: The use of a comprehensive UI component library will speed up the development process, allowing us to bring the Study Planner App to market more quickly, which is essential for students.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: React Native Elements' performance optimization will result in a smoother and more responsive user experience, improving user satisfaction, and helping students stay organized in their study routines.
3. **Scalability**: The toolkit's customizability and compatibility ensure that the UI can be easily scaled as the app evolves, accommodating additional features and enhancements as needed for students' study needs.
5. **Training and Familiarization**: Team members may need some time to familiarize themselves with React Native Elements, but the extensive documentation and community support should mitigate the learning curve, allowing them to become proficient quickly.

## Conclusion
Selecting React Native Elements as our UI toolkit aligns with our goals for efficient development, optimal performance, and a user-friendly experience, essential for a study planner app's success. With the extensive support and flexibility it offers, we believe this decision will contribute to the effectiveness and popularity of our Study Planner App among students.
